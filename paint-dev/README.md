## Current state of paint-dev

Got the terminal into a THREEjs environment, but nothing is written on it.

Got the THREEjs environment into Gotty, but nothing was written on it.

I think I'm missing something like the equivalent of a render loop for running the terminal.

Looking through some more examples from the xtermjs list:
* [this one](https://github.com/qwefgh90/ng-terminal.git) has nice instructions
* [this one](https://github.com/saisandeepvaddi/ten-hands) is very advanced and maybe too much to read through
* [this one](https://github.com/elisescu/tty-share) is a ripoff off gotty and maybe my best bet for progress
* [this one](https://github.com/huashengdun/webssh) is written in python and may just be a winner
